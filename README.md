## 📊 Data Handling Approach

Since this project uses **minimal backend**, data handling is done mainly on the frontend.

### 1. Static Data
- Stored in `/src/data/` folder
- Example:
  - Product details
  - Features list
  - FAQ content
- Data is exported as JavaScript objects/arrays

### 2. Forms & User Input
- Contact form handled using:
  - React `useState`
  - Basic form validation
- Data can be:
  - Logged to console
  - Stored temporarily
  - Extended later to backend or email service

### 3. Backend Scope (Optional)
- Only if required:
  - Simple API endpoint
  - Email or inquiry submission
- No database dependency for current phase
